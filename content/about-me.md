Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a spain-based software engineer passionate about all things development. In this blog I will share some stuff I find interesting about software engineering, along with some random musings on today's tendencies. My range of interests comes from C# ( my main language), databases, architecture, patterns, DDD, a bit of frontend here and there and computer science topics. 

About my non-dev interests, I am a sports guy, guitar player and ocasional gamer.

NOTE:

*This blog is a WIP thing; though I am not a frontender per sÃ©, I wanted to cook the whole thing by myself - with the help of Vue and Nuxt.js of course! - So don't expect the fanciest responsiveness, design and whatnot from this ;)*
